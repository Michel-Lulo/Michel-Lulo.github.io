<h1> How to Navigate NRG Systems Through Google Colab </h1>

<p> Hello. This is a simple web page that will guide you through using python in order to quickly export site data from NRG Systems. </p>

<p> Here is a link to the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UQwz7_5s5s5p0k-PdunLvrWDFUn7zb6H?usp=sharing">Official Google Colab</a> that we will be using. </p>

<h2> Make a copy </h2>

<p> To make a copy you must have a google drive account. After that, making a copy is as simple as going to file and clicking on "Save a copy in Drive".</p>

<h2> Set a date range </h2>

<p> Begin by setting a start and end date in the highlighted section under "Site Info". Ensure that the format you set each of the dates is "year-month-day". </p>

<p> Look at the image below for reference: </p>

<h2> Run the program </h2>

<p> Click the "run all" command as shown in the image below: </p>

<h2> Choose a project site </h2>

<p> After clicking the run all command, a list of projects should appear under "Site Info" as seen in the image below: " </p>

<p> Simply keep in mind the "siteNumber" and "siteDescription" for later use. </p>

<h2> Rewrite the program </h2>

<p> Under "Execute", rewrite the site number at "insert site number" and the site name at "insert site name". Make sure to delete everything in the parenthesis and the parenthesis itself. </p>

<h2> Re-run the program </h2>

<p> Once again, click the "run-all" command. </p>

<h2> Determine which channel/s to graph </h2>

<p> A list with a short overview of every channel should now appear under "Execute". </p>

<p> Decide and keep in mind which channels you want to analyze, for later on. </p>

<h2> How to graph the data </h2>

<p> Place a square bracket at the end of "y_axis = reader.data" to see a dropdown menu with the channels available to choose from. Look at the visual for reference: </p>

<h2> More graphing tips </h2>

<p> You can also add more channels to the graph by simply creating another y-axis and line corresponding to the same figure as before. When creating the new line, make sure to use the same x-axis, but to change the y-axis and the color. The figure below shows a general and simple way to graph multiple channels. </p>
